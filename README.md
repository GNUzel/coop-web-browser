Co-op/Cooperative Web Browser: A web browser for two or more people to control, allowing for collaboration and fun together. 

Original Concept: 
To create a Google+ Hangouts Application to allow for friends and/or co-workers to collaborate together on an Internet browser in which all parties control. 

Mock Up Design:

Possible Secondary Concept: A standalone application that allows for browsing the web, with control of the browser from multiple parties across a network. (multiple = 2 or more.)
